# EnglishCourseGrowthAnalysis
Visualizing and analyzing English course enrollment data with MATLAB. This project evaluates the exponential growth model by examining the trend in student numbers over 8 years.


•
Over the last eight years, the enrollment numbers for an English course have been as follows: 15, 20, 30, 45, 65, 90, 120, and 155 students, respectively. This trend suggests that class sizes may be experiencing exponential growth. To analyze this growth pattern, let's plot these enrollment figures on a standard graph using MATLAB.


Use magenta square symbols ('ms') for the data points, and make sure that each marker is a line of size 10 ('MarkerSize', 10) and width 4 ('LineWidth', 4). Note that there should be no lines connecting the data points.

•
Adjust the x-axis limits (xlim) as necessary to make sure that all eight data points are clearly visible on the graph. •
Label the x-axis as "Year" and the y-axis as "Number of Students".

•
Provide a title for your graph, such as "Growth in Class Size in an English Class Over 8 Years."

•
Include a brief discussion interpreting the graph and whether the growth appears exponential when viewed on a standard graph.
